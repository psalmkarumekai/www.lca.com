<h3>The History of Lifestyle Christian Academy</h3>


  <p>In 1988, LCA was founded by German pastor and missionaries Johannes Eberhard & Christa Giesler. In the 2000s, it developed into a school with about 200 students. Students graduating through LCA are expected to contribute to the country and the region. It was remarkable school in Worcester. <br>
  </p>
  
  <p>However, in 2007, the school was unable to secure sufficient financial resources, and it became difficult to operate the school. At the end of 2011, the school announced to be closed at the end of 2011 as it had to leave the government building that was used for lease (as it started to use the dormitory as a nurse training program). After announcing, there were seven students and four teachers left. Some of the leaders of the school, who had a closed-minded decision but were saddened by this decision, sought to find a new leader who could overcome this difficulty. Then they pointed out a missionary couple who came from South Korea.  <br>
 </p> 
  
  <p>Korean missionary couple (Mr. Jongwoo Kim and Mrs. HJ Connie Kim) started to rebuild schools in difficult conditions with the remaining four teachers and seven students. In January 2012, the school resumed with 7 students. and in August 2015, the first school building of LCA was built on the ground of the NGO group called YWAM(Youth With A Mission) in Worcester. In February 2017, LCA has completed another building in YWAM. And in September 2021, LCA has completed a new building for high school on the farm. At present,  we are focusing on cultivating african young leadership who will serve and influence not only for the local community but also for African and the world. <br>
  </p>
  
 <p> There were a lot of volunteers from overseas that it was possible to provide good quality education with low cost of tuition. Since 2013, volunteers with a variety of skills in the United States and especially in South Korea have contributed to the growth of LCA for three months or a year for our students. As a construction worker to maintain and build our school, a musician to teach how to play the musical instruments, a art teacher to help children's arts education, a swimming coach to teach swimming, an English teacher to teach English, and many other talented volunteers. They have come to a small village of Worcester in South Africa to support the growth of young children in Africa. Because these volunteers, music and arts are already recognized as excellent educational levels in the region.  <br>

<h2>MISSION STATEMENT</h2>
<strong><p>STATEMENT OF FAITH </p></strong>

 

<p>-Lifestyle Christian Academy views itself as an indispensable part of the three major forces in the life of each child: the home, the school and the church. Lifestyle Christian Academy was founded and functions upon the basic fundamental principles of the Word of God, and it espouses the historic Christian view of life as presented in the Bible. The following statement of faith and practice are held by LCA:
</p>
 

<p>-We Believe in God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit and   that they are distinct personalities with distinct roles, but one God. And  that One God is the Creator of the universe. (Genesis 1:1; Matthew 28:19; John 10:30).
</p>
 

<p>-We Believe the Bible is the divinely inspired Word of God in its entirety and that it does not contradict itself. It is our guide. (2 Timothy 3:15; 2 Peter 1:21).
</p>
 

<p>-We Believe Jesus Christ is the Messiah, the Savior, the Son of God (John 10:33), who was born of a virgin (Isaiah 7:14), lived a sinless life (Hebrews 4:15, 7:26), died on a cross (1 Corinthians 15:3; Ephesians 1:7; Hebrews 2:9), and was raised from the grave (John 11:25; 1 Corinthians 15:4). He will return as our victorious Lord (Acts 1:11; Revelation 19:11).
</p>
 

<p>-We Believe our salvation comes only through Jesus Christ and cannot be earned. It is a gift of God. (John 3:16-19, 5:24; Romans 3:23, 5:8-9; Ephesians 2:9-10; Titus 3:5).
</p>
 

<p>-We Believe the church, as the body of Christ, is the extension of Jesus Christ's character, attitude, behavior, and mission in our world today. (Ephesians 1:22-23; 4:15-16)
</p>
 

<p>-We Believe faith in Jesus requires repentance, confession of that faith before witnesses, obedience to His Word. Baptism by immersion demonstrates our faith and obedience while it depicts our union with Christ in His death, burial and resurrection. (Acts 2:38).
</p>

<p>-We Believe man was created in the image of God and that He gives gifts to both men and women through the Holy Spirit for the benefit of the church's ministry. (Genesis 2:26-27; Ephesians 4:7-16; Colossians 1:18-20).
</p>
 

<p>-We Believe everyone who accepts Christ has the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit who acts as a Comforter, Guide, and Advocate. (Romans 8:12-14).
</p>
 

<p>-We Believe that humility in prayer is the foundation for all we do and that celebrating communion together weekly is beneficial for all Christians (1 Thessalonians 5:17-18; Acts 2:46-47).
</p>
 

<p>-We Believe marriage has been established by God. This church defines "marriage" as the exclusive covenantal union of one man and one woman in which such union is a lifetime commitment. A civil government's sanction of a union will be recognized as a legitimate marriage by the church only to the extent that it is consistent with the definition of "marriage" found in these Articles. (Genesis 2:21-24; Mark 10:6-9).
