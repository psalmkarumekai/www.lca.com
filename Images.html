<h3>1) Sports</h3>

<p>LCA aims for continued participation from our students and our students take part in a weekly Physical Education class. Information regarding sport events will be communicated via letter, that would be handed out to the students at least a week before the event. 

If any information regarding learners should be disclosed, it should be communicated directly to the coach or to the sports Organiser. We believe that sports can help each one of our learners to develop their talents, strengths and good attitude toward other people.

<h3>3) Field trip</h3>



<p>LCA field trip is a journey taken by our leaners to a place away from their usual environment. In education, field trips are defined as visits to an outside area of the normal classroom and made by a teacher and students for purposes of firsthand observation. Field trips are a popular method carried out for students to introduce to the concepts, experiences, and ideas that cannot be given in a classroom environment. Exploring other cultures and customs to broaden their mind, getting to the motherland of languages, uncovering pristine nature and experiencing fascinating local life are striking demonstrations of educational field trips.
